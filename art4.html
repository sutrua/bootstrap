      <div class="text-bg-info p-3">Kuchipudi, a pre-eminent Indian classical dance form counted among ten leading classical dance forms of India, is a dance-drama performance art that originated in a village of Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh, India. Similar to all leading Indian classical dance forms, Kuchipudi too evolved as a religious art rooting back to the age-old Hindu Sanskrit text 'Natya Shastra' and connects traditionally with temples, spiritual faiths and travelling bards. This ancient dance form finds place in the 10th century copper inscriptions and in 15th century texts like 'Machupalli Kaifat'. Traditionally it is regarded that the sanyassin of Advaita Vedanta sect, Tirtha Narayana Yati, and his disciple Siddhendra Yogi initiated, methodized and arranged the present day version of the dance form in 17th century. Usually performance repertoire of Kuchipudi that is broadly oriented on Lord Krishna and the tradition of Vaishnavism include an invocation, dharavu - short dance, nritta - pure dance and nritya - expressive dance respectively.</div>
      <div class="text-bg-info p-3">The 10th century copper inscriptions validate the existence of Shaivism associated dance drama performance acts called 'Brahmana Melas' or 'Brahma Melas' in regions of South India with Telugu speaking populace. Brahmins performed this art during the medieval era. Vaishnavism that traditionally include Bhakti music and dance dedicated to Lord Krishna and evolved during the 2nd millennium presumably embraced this art form. It developed in South India's Tamil region as 'Bhagavata Mela Nataka' and in Andhra region as Kuchipudi. Saskia Kersenboom mentions that both 'Bhagavata Mela Nataka' and Kuchipudi are closely related to the traditional theatre form of Karnataka called 'Yakshagana' and also incorporate Carnatic music like the latter, however the three retain their uniqueness palpable from their varied costume, format, innovative ideas and perceptions. Again author Manohar Laxman Varadpande states that this form came up in the late 13th century during the reign of the Eastern Ganga dynasty of Kalinga, who patronized art forms based on works of famed Sanskrit poet Jayadeva, most notably the 'Gita Govinda'. Such auspices of the monarch saw several dance-drama troupes and bards incorporating concepts based on Radha and Krishna in traditional Kuchipudi, which were locally called 'Vaishnava Bhagavatulus'.</div>
