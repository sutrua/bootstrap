      <div class="text-bg-info p-3">Mohiniattam or Mohiniyattam is an Indian classical dance form that evolved in the state of Kerala, India, and is counted among the two popular dance arts of the state, the other being Kathakali. Although its roots date back to the age-old Sanskrit Hindu text on performing arts called 'Natya Shastra', similar to other Indian classical dance forms, Mohiniattam adheres to the Lasya type that showcases a more graceful, gentle and feminine form of dancing. Mohiniattam derives its name from the word 'Mohini', a female avatar of Lord Vishnu. Conventionally a solo dance performed by female artists, it emotes a play through dancing and singing where the song is customarily in Manipravala which is a mix of Sanskrit and Malayalam language and the recitation may be either performed by the dancer herself or by a vocalist with the music style being Carnatic.</div>
      <div class="text-bg-info p-3">Mohiniattam evolved from the state of Kerala which also has an association with the old tradition of Lasya style of dancing. The temple sculptures of the state are the earliest manifestations of Mohiniattam or other dance forms similar to it. Mohiniattam poses are also palpable from the various feminine sculptures that adorn the 11th century Vishnu temple at Trikodithanam, and the Kidangur Subramanya temple. The Lasya theme was incorporated by Malayalam bards and playwrights, a fact evident from the text-based records starting from the 12th century. The 16th century book titled 'Vyavaharamala' written by scholar, poet, author and astrologer Mazhamangalam Narayanan Namboodiri is the first known book that mentions the term Mohiniyattam in connection with a payment due to a Mohiniyattam dancer. While discussing about various performing art forms of Kerala, renowned poet Kunchan Nambiar in his 17th century book 'Gosha Yatra' mentioned about Mohiniyattam. By that time this dance form had emerged as one of the classical art forms of the state. The 18th century Sanskrit treatise 'Balarama Bharatam' on natyam written by the king of Travancore Karthika Thirunal Bala Rama Varma (considered to be a significant secondary work on 'Natya Shastra') refers about 'Mohino Natana'among various other dance styles<br>Mohiniattam developed further as a performing art during the 18th and 19th centuries, thanks to the patronage of several princely states. The initiation and patronage of the Maharaja of the Kingdom of Travancore, Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma, a poet and brilliant music composer himself, in the early 19th century saw development of a joint team of artists of two genres namely Bharatanatyam and Mohiniattam. His contributions in the art form saw the eventual development and systematization of present day Mohiniattam.</div>
