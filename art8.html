      <div class="text-bg-info p-3">Sattriya Dance has its origin in the 'Sattriyas' established by Mahapurush Srimanta Sankardev in the 15th and the 16th century. The Sattras were established for the propagation of Vaishnavism and later they became the religious, cultural and social hub for the people of Assam. The great Vaishnavite Saint has developed this dance form with its basic roots aligned with the characteristics of other forms of Indian classical dance. Initially a part of the 'Ankia Naats', this dance form derived its name from the word 'Sattriyas' .This dance form was originally performed in the Sattras and the Namghars by the male Bhokots as a part of religious rituals and for spreading the philosophy of Vaishnavism and was confined within the four walls of the sattras for several centuries.</div>
      <div class="text-bg-info p-3">Six types of Anga (Limb), six types of Pratyanga, six types of Upanga (Lower limb), nine different types of Gatived (Movement), eight types of Dristived (Eye movement), nine types of Shiraved (Head movement), four types Gribaved (Neck movement) are found in Sattriya dance. The musical instruments used in Sattriya are the Khols or the Drums, the Taals or the Cymbals and the Flute.
